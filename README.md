## Project Overview

The sample e-commerce website allows users to browse through a diverse catalog of products, search for specific items, and apply various filters to refine their search results. Additionally, users can add products to their shopping cart, manage the cart contents, and proceed to checkout to complete their purchases.

The real-time nature of the application ensures that users are kept informed about product availability. When a product is running low in stock, users receive immediate updates. Furthermore, if a product becomes out of stock, users are promptly notified.

Key Features:

- Browse and search for products
- Apply filters to narrow down product search results
- Manage shopping cart and update cart contents
- View order history and order status
- Post reviews for products and read other users' reviews
- User authentication for secure access to certain features
- Stripe implementation for payment processing (using testing credit cards)
- The application boasts a responsive user interface that provides feedback on loading processes and displays error messages when necessary. This ensures a smooth and enjoyable user experience throughout the shopping journey.

Please note that since this is a sample e-commerce website, the Stripe payment integration is configured to accept testing credit cards only. However, detailed instructions on using the provided testing credit card details will be provided to the users.

Feel free to explore the website and experience the seamless functionality and responsive design it offers!
